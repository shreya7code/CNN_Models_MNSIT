# CNN Classifier & Pretrained Model Comparison on MNIST Dataset

This project compares training performance of a custom CNN with pretrained models (ResNet18, AlexNet, LeNet) on MNIST dataset using PyTorch.

## Features
- CNN from scratch with dropout & early stopping
- Pretrained model customization
- Accuracy & loss comparison visuals

## Models Used
- 🧠 Custom 6-layer CNN
- 🔁 ResNet18
- 📦 AlexNet
- 📜 LeNet (custom recreated)

## 📊 Plots
- Training vs Validation Accuracy
- Training vs Validation Loss

## How to Run
Open the `notebook.ipynb` on Google Colab or run locally using Jupyter.
